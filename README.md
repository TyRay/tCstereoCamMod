Previously, an aftermarket camera was installed on Tyler LeClear's 2014 Scion tC. The only way the camera functioned was to supply power to it continuously. Develope a software/hardware solution to the power the camera on during the vehicle's ignition, turn off 5 seconds later, and power on upon placing the tC in reverse.
